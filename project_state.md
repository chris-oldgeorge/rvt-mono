# Project State

## RVT Mono-Repository Bootstrap - 2026-07-22

- Workspace: `/Users/oldgeorge/Documents/rvt-mono`
- Status: Task 3 aggregate solution, approved logical solution-folder
  organization, solution guard, and root onboarding documentation complete.
- Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-rvt-mono-repository-design.md`
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-22-rvt-mono-repository-bootstrap.md`
- Requested outcome: fresh unified Git history and a shared root solution for
  `rvt-monitors`, `rvtportal-spa-alpha`, `rvt-reporting`, and
  `rvt-reporting-new`.
- Intended modules: `apps/monitors`, `apps/portal`,
  `libs/rvt-monitor-common`, and `services/reporting`.
- Root solution: `Rvt.Mono.slnx`.
- Pending approved design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-rvt-common-source-reference-design.md` changes active consumers to source project references, while package-validation remains package-based against locally packed artifacts. This is an explicit decision to review if independent package consumption becomes required again.
- Aggregate project count: 38 projects across all four module roots.
- Important boundary: retain module-local build/NuGet configuration and the
  private RVT shared-package boundary during the initial import. Do not merge
  reporting implementations or database schemas.
- Imported source snapshots:
  - `apps/monitors` from `chris-oldgeorge/rvt-monitors` at
    `5935f40614073afa6c4ef954db1308a72a5f8f2b`.
  - `apps/portal` from `chris-oldgeorge/rvtportal-spa-alpha` at
    `8355070f094a591297c9f8468057f44a6c876986`.
  - `libs/rvt-monitor-common` from `RVT-Group-LTD/rvt-reporting` at
    `f00d5b8a320945ed08e248da8641ca0c3f7e3b82`.
  - `services/reporting` from `chris-oldgeorge/rvt-reporting-new` at
    `e602e8317e35bd94a1eb4dd017759b91713ea111`.
- Import staging directory: `/private/tmp/rvt-mono-import.2w115l` (retained
  through Task 3 final verification).
- Import verification: all staged repositories were checked out detached at
  their exact manifest revisions; imported trees checksum-match the staged
  content with `.git` excluded; no nested `.git` directory exists below the
  module roots.
- Known environment note: authenticated GitHub metadata access was available;
  source clone/restore access must be verified during implementation. Never
  record credentials in this repository.
- Task 1 guard: `.gitignore` excludes generated files, environment files, and
  `.superpowers/sdd/` controller state. `docs/imports/source-manifest.md` pins
  the four approved source snapshots. Repository bootstrap commits through the
  source import are design `1327b84`, plan `0abf895`, guard `ae65789`, and
  source import `31d168f`.
- Task 3 guard: `tests/verify-mono-solution.test.sh` runs
  `scripts/verify-mono-solution.sh`. It compares normalized, sorted module
  `*.csproj` paths with the normalized, sorted `dotnet sln Rvt.Mono.slnx list`
  paths, requires matching project counts and per-module representation, and
  enforces exact project placement under `Apps/Monitors`, `Apps/Portal`,
  `Libraries/RVT Monitor Common`, and `Services/Reporting`, with test projects
  in each module's corresponding `Tests` solution folder.
- Verification results:
  - `tests/verify-mono-solution.test.sh` and
    `tests/verify-mono-layout.test.sh` pass.
  - `dotnet sln Rvt.Mono.slnx list` reports all 38 module projects.
  - `dotnet restore Rvt.Mono.slnx` is blocked by private package access:
    GitHub Packages returns HTTP 401 for the RVT organization feed. Cached RVT
    `0.2.0-rc.1` packages also produce NU1403 content-hash validation errors.
  - `dotnet build Rvt.Mono.slnx --no-restore --nologo` exits with 16 errors
    from the same NU1301/NU1403 package state; unaffected projects do compile.
  - Package feeds and dependency declarations were not changed.
